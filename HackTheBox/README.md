HackTheBox (HTB) is a well-known cyber security training platform that provides a wide range of machines for users to practice their penetration testing skills. These machines come in various levels of difficulty, ranging from beginner-friendly to highly advanced, and are designed to simulate real-world scenarios. In addition to the machines, HTB also offers challenges that users can tackle to test their knowledge and skills in specific areas of cyber security. Overall, HTB is a valuable resource for anyone interested in improving their cyber security skills through hands-on experience.

I don't want to ruin the fun for those who want to try either the challenge or machine with their own hands, so for all machine writeup both the `user` and `root` flag won't be provided - also the `challenge flag`. Eventhough I provide some script or even solver (mostly for the `pwn` category), I hope you do try to understand and still try it yourself :smile:. Happy hacking :fire:!!

Oh yeah, here is some indicator to make your read easier,
