ROP Emporium is a series of challenges to learn `Return Oriented Programming (ROP)` by practicing it. It covers a complete challenges from beginner level to advanced level of stack and heap.

Below I present you my solution to solve the challenges and the link to the ROP-Emporium sites, if you are searching for a different version of the challenges, you can use the link that redirect you to the respective challenge page. 

Since I'm using a `Ubuntu 20.04 LTS`, I'll be writting the solution from `x86_64 (64bit binary)` and `x86 (32bit binary)`.
