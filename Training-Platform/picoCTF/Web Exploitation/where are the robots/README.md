# where are the robots
## Overview
Points: 100
Category: Web Exploitation

## Description
Can you find the robots? https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/36474/ or http://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org:36474

## Hints

1. What part of the website could tell you where the creator doesn't want you to look?

## Solution

By the tittle we could tell that this challenge will involve `/robots.txt` somehow, we just need to open the website and check if it's true.

On the homepage it askes us `where is the robots?` as expected then... let's just go to the `/robots.txt` and see the flag (maybe).

```
User-agent: *
Disallow: /477ce.html
```

In the txt we can see a Disallow directory, commonly we can see this kind if restriction in `robots.txt` file, it'll tell anyone who open it, what directories the developer want keep us away, unfortunately we found the `/477ce.html`, we just need to open it and we finish the challenge.
