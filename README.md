## CTF Categories

Based on my experience, there are 5 main categories in CTF Competitions, which mean in any CTF these category would likely appear as the challenge, and those are:  

| **Cateogry** | **Explanation** | 
| :---:  | :---:  |
| **Cryptography**| mainly deal with `encoding`, `encryption`, `hashing`, `ciphers`, and many algorithms.  |
| **Forensic** | Usually based on real-world scenarios and can include `file format analysis`, `steganography`, `memory dump analysis`, or `network packet capture analysis`. Sometimes it also `includes Malware Analysis` or post-attack scenarios. |
| **Binary Exploitation** | Exploit bugs or vulnerabilities to cause unintended or unexpected behavior in `stack`, `heap`, `kernel` or even `web` |
| **Reverse Engineering** | Just like its name, you'll work around a compiled program and try to reverse it, the compiled program can be anything from a `c`, `java`, `go-lang` and many more. |
| **Web Exploitation** | Exploit vulnerabilities in web-based applications to gain access to sensitive data or control over the app, usually involves `SQL Injection`, `Cross-site Scripting`, `IDOR`, `Local File Inclusion`, etc. |

However there are also some categories that not every CTF offers, due to their rare appearance, you might be surprised if you happen to come across one of these categories,

| **Cateogry** | **Explanation** | 
| :---:  | :---:  |
| **Blockchain** | Working around smart contract challenges sounds fun doesn't it, it can even combine some categories like, Reverse Engineering, Forensic and sometimes Binary Exploitation. The Challenges can be anything from `Contract analysis`, `log analysis`, `exploiting and reversing smart contracts`, or just simply `searching addresses`. |
| **DFIR** | **DFIR** stands for Digital Forensics and Incident Response, as you already guessed, this category offers you a similar challenge you get from Forensics, the difference I noticed is DFIR CTF Challenge usually works around `SIEMS (Security information and event management)` log analysis. |
| **OSINT** | Open Soure Intelligence(OSINT) is a very fine addition to the main categories in my opinion, we just need to do some research and we got the answer. |
| **Hardware** | This category is also new for me, I've only encountered a challenge, where the flag is hidden in PCE-like images.|
