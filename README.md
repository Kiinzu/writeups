## What is a CTF?
CTF stands for "Capture The Flag". It is a type of cybersecurity competition where participants must solve various challenges related to various topics such as cryptography, reverse engineering, web exploitation, and more. The goal is to find flags, which are usually pieces of data hidden within the challenge. These flags can be used to score points and win the competition.

CTF competitions are a great way to improve your cybersecurity skills and learn new techniques. They are often used as a training ground for aspiring cybersecurity professionals and are also popular among experienced practitioners. CTFs can be organized as individual events or as part of larger conferences or competitions. Many CTFs are also held online, which allows participants from around the world to compete.

If you are interested in participating in CTFs, there are many resources available online to help you get started. Some popular CTF websites include CTFtime, picoCTF, and Hack The Box. You can also find many tutorials and write-ups from past CTF competitions that can help you learn new skills and strategies.

With that being said, the three comon types of CTF is **Jeopardy**, **Attack-Defense** and **Mixed**.

## Categories

Based on my experience, there are 5 main categories in CTF Competitions, which mean in any CTF these category would likely appear as the challenge, and those are:  

| **Cateogry** | **Explanation** | 
| :---:  | :---:  |
| **Cryptography**| mainly deal with `encoding`, `encryption`, `hashing`, `ciphers`, and many algorithms.  |
| **Forensic** | Usually based on real-world scenarios and can include `file format analysis`, `steganography`, `memory dump analysis`, or `network packet capture analysis`. Sometimes it also `includes Malware Analysis` or post-attack scenarios. |
| **Binary Exploitation** | Exploit bugs or vulnerabilities to cause unintended or unexpected behavior in `stack`, `heap`, `kernel` or even `web` |
| **Reverse Engineering** | Just like its name, you'll work around a compiled program and try to reverse it, the compiled program can be anything from a `c`, `java`, `go-lang` and many more. |
| **Web Exploitation** | Exploit vulnerabilities in web-based applications to gain access to sensitive data or control over the app, usually involves `SQL Injection`, `Cross-site Scripting`, `IDOR`, `Local File Inclusion`, etc. |

However there are also some categories that not every CTF offers, due to their rare appearance, you might be surprised if you happen to come across one of these categories,

| **Cateogry** | **Explanation** | 
| :---:  | :---:  |
| **Blockchain** | Working around smart contract challenges sounds fun doesn't it, it can even combine some categories like, Reverse Engineering, Forensic and sometimes Binary Exploitation. The Challenges can be anything from `Contract analysis`, `log analysis`, `exploiting and reversing smart contracts`, or just simply `searching addresses`. |
| **DFIR** | **DFIR** stands for Digital Forensics and Incident Response, as you already guessed, this category offers you a similar challenge you get from Forensics, the difference I noticed is DFIR CTF Challenge usually works around `SIEMS (Security information and event management)` log analysis. |
| **OSINT** | Open Soure Intelligence(OSINT) is a very fine addition to the main categories in my opinion, we just need to do some research and we got the answer. If you want to try this category, you can try [GeoGuessr](https://www.geoguessr.com/) ( only GeoINT). |
| **Hardware** | This category is also new for me, I've only encountered a challenge, where the flag is hidden in PCE-like images.|
