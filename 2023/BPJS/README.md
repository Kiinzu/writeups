## About BPJS Hackathon 2023

This event is not only focused on cyber security sector (ctf), but also Inovation system and Data Analytic. I however participate in the CTF with my team Moai, although the system or platform is rather a bit difficult to navigate alongside the issues present along the competition, I have to say that i enjoy solving the Blockchain Challenges.
