## Challenges

I don't actually know much about this CTF other than hosted by UGM (Universitas Gajah Mada). Overall I did enjoy solving the challenge in this CTF with my Team, for most of the challenge no additional set-up is required,but somes sadly I can't do it because of many error :sob:. Putting that aside, I'm happy to compete in this CTF.

Below are challenges that I managed to solve during the CTF (although I only focus on the pwn :grin:)
