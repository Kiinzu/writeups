## What is Gemastik?
Gemastik, short for "Gelar Mahasiswa Nasional Bidang Teknologi Informasi dan Komunikasi," is an esteemed annual event in Indonesia that serves as a dynamic platform for students to showcase their prowess in the realms of technology and communication. This national student competition brings together creative minds from diverse universities to engage in a series of challenges spanning programming, software development, cybersecurity, web and mobile app development, and more.

## Challenges

The challenge in the CTF is a very fine one, I spend most of my time researching the 2nd pwn challenge `apa ini` which is a FSOP Vulnerability

We managed to secure 2nd place in the Final featuring an Attack & Defense style CTF. I was assigned to do the patching and pwn challenge, but I was missing the libc to solve the challenge, we manage to do a first blood on a web challenge.
