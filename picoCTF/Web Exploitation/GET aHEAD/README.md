## Hints

1. Maybe you have more than 2 choices
2. Check out tools like Burpsuite to modify your requests and look at the responses

## Solution

See something sus about the Challenge Name? 'GET aHEAD', let's assume they want us the get the `HEAD` from this url, so how do we solve this challenge? I present to you `curl`, you can do anything as long you got a URL, in this case we want to get the head, so how do we do it with curl?

using `man curl` you will se something like this 

```
       -I, --head
              (HTTP FTP FILE) Fetch the headers only! HTTP-servers feature the
              command HEAD which this uses to get nothing but the header of  a
              Providing -I, --head multiple times has no extra  effect.   Dis‚Äê
              able it again with --no-head.
```

okay- now we know what flag do we need to catch the header, let's get the header now.

You can use either one below-  
Using `--head`

```curl http://mercury.picoctf.net:15931/ --head```  
Using `-I`

```curl http://mercury.picoctf.net:15931/ -I```  

Now you got the flag

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
flag: picoCTF{r3j3ct_th3_du4l1ty_82880908}
Content-type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
