# Scavenger Hunt
## Overview
Points: 50  
Category: Web Exploitation

## Description
There is some interesting information hidden around this site http://mercury.picoctf.net:27393/. Can you find it?

## Hints

1. You should have enough hints to find the files, don't run a brute forcer.

## Solution

After we go to the URL provided, we can see 'almost' the same website as [Insp3ct0r](../Insp3ct0r/), so I just assume, to solve it we need to do exactly the same with Inspector but maybe it will be harder since the point is different.

We will start by doing the usual, `CTRL+U` on the homepage and inpect the source code, there we can see the first part of the flag.

      <div id="tabintro" class="tabcontent">

		<p>How do you like my website?</p>
      </div>

      <div id="tababout" class="tabcontent">
		<h3>What</h3>
		<p>I used these to make this site: <br/>
		  HTML <br/>
		  CSS <br/>
		  JS (JavaScript)

	<!-- Here's the first part of the flag: picoCTF{t -->

</html>
```

We are going to explore the `mycss.css` and `myjs.js` like we did in the previous challenge. Exploring the myjs.js gives us nothing, but mycss.css did give us something.

```css
/* CSS makes the page look nice, and yes, it also has part of the flag. Here's part 2: h4ts_4_l0 */
```

We got our 2nd flag from the bottom part of the code, now where do we go next? In a website is a good move to check the `/robots.txt`, sometime it'll give you a good information or maybe a flag :smile:

```
Disallow: /index.html
# Part 3: t_0f_pl4c
# I think this is an apache server... can you Access the next flag?
```

Look, we got our third part and a question, it wonder if we can access the next flag, but why the 'a' in Access is in capital? Well we can take that as a hint, no? Normally when you want to keep something hidden, you'll add a `'.'` in front of the file/directory-name. Same goes with Apache, it has a lot of hidden directories, on of them is called `.htaccess`, we can try to open this in the website now.

```
# Part 4: 3s_2_lO0k
# I love making websites on my Mac, I can Store a lot of information there.
``` 

I thought it was only 4 parts... well, here we go again for the 5th part, he said he love making a website from mac, because he can store a lot of information there, to be honest, I didn't see the capital 'S' there and just search `"Store Web Information on Mac"` on google and found something called `.DS_Store` and try to open it on the website.

```
Congrats! You completed the scavenger hunt. Part 5: _d375c750}
```

Alright, just combine all the part we found and we finish this challenge :relaxed:
