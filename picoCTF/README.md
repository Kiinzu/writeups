You may be interested in participating in picoCTF, a computer security game designed to teach students computer security concepts and techniques. It is open to anyone, but primarily aimed at middle and high school students in the United States. You can find more information at [https://picoctf.com/](https://picoctf.com/).

Additionally, if you're interested in learning more about offensive and defensive security, as well as other topics such as blockchain, crypto, forensic, OSINT, and more, I highly recommend checking out my other Repositories.

All of the content is published on GitHub and Medium, so you can easily access it and learn at your own pace.
